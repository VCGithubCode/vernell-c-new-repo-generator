# Template for Quick Static Site Generator

###### This was built to speed up the process of creating a static site. It is not intended to be used as-is, but rather serve as a template that can be used to create a static site.

### This is a template repository to help you create your own static site.

**Just for funsies there are a few easter eggs included.  Can you find all 5 stars?**

## **Deployment**

I deployed the project on Github pages using the following steps:

- From the project's Repository, go to the "Settings" tab (gear icon in the top right).
- Look at the menu on the left. From the left-hand menu options, select the _Pages_ tab.
- Select the _Main_ branch from under the _Source_ section dropdown and click _Save_.
- After a few minutes, a message will display to indicate a successful deployment and provide a _Live link_.
